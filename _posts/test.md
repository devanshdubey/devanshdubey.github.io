This is my first threat analysis report. I've picked the RedLine Stealer because it was gaining popularity in early 2020 and is still being widely spread in Dec 2021 (probably because of its continuous updates). There are already some articles about this malware and a decent amount of IOCs which I linked in the [References](#references).
